## Task 5
# Run the clustering algorithms
# TODO: Run both the clustering algortihms for both spherical and non-sperical data (so in total 4 function calls)


# Compute and print the evaluation metrics
# TODO: Compute both the silhoutte scores and purity scores - each for both kmeans++ algorithm and aglomerative algorithm, for both datasets.
# So in total, 8 function calls. 
# Print all the 8 values.

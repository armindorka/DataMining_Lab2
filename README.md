# DataMining_Lab2
This is the 2nd Lab of the Data Mining course at my home university.

The lab covered the following ideas:

Task1: Creating spherical and non-spherical datasets

Task2: Implementing KMeans++ algorithm

Task3: Creation of a distance matrix, and implementing agglomerative clustering.

Task4: Performmance evaluation (intra-cluster distance, nearest-cluster distance --> silhouette score, purity score)

Task5: Run the algorithms, and write out the evaluation metrics
